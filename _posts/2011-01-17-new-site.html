title: New website
---

<p>This website is entirely static. It's hosted as a <a href="https://github.com/aantthony/aantthony.github.com">git repository</a> and generated using this awesome program called <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">jekyll</a>. I'm still migrating some of the old stuff here, but I probably won't keep everything. I don't know what to do with the ~500 scribbles yet.</p>
<p>Below are some images of what the site used to look like.</p>
